These are fundamental building blocks for solving a long list of different algorithms, and they’ll come up again and again as you keep researching.\n","\n","Take the code presented in this tutorial, create new experiments, and explore these algorithms further. Better yet, try implementing other sorting algorithms in Python. The list is vast, but [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), [heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort), and [tree sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_sort) are three excellent options to start with."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"vyper","language":"python","name":"vyper"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"45b531d7c09ad6c6b055397439744606b917655a6bf72b8a3f854620ee4933ce"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
