# Analyzing Time Complexity in Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to my project on analyzing time complexity in sorting algorithms using Python! This project is aimed at investigating the performance of different sorting algorithms in terms of their time complexity. The goal is to provide an in-depth analysis of the most commonly used sorting algorithms and to evaluate their relative efficiency in terms of time complexity, using Python as the implementation language.

## Implementation in Python

The project includes an implementation of various sorting algorithms in Python, including:

    Bubble sort
    Insertion sort
    Selection sort
    Merge sort
    Quick sort

## Analysis of Time Complexity

The time complexity of each sorting algorithm is analyzed using both theoretical and empirical methods. The results of the analysis are presented in the form of graphs, tables, and other visualizations, allowing for easy comparison and interpretation of the data.

## Discussion and Further Research

In addition to the core analysis, the project also includes a discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the different sorting algorithms, as well as suggestions for further research in this area.

Overall, the project provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms and their performance in different scenarios, using Python as the implementation language.
